# Faust Samples
This repository contains some sample codes for [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr).
These are just for my personal practice.

# Samples
## [2op-fm.dsp](./samples/2op-fm.dsp)
A simple two-operator FM synthesizer sample.

Parameters can be controlled by sliders and the tone can be triggered by buttons. The modulator (op1) contains a feedback circuit.

## [4op-fm.dsp](./samples/4op-fm.dsp)
A simple four-operator FM synthesizer sample.

In addition to the above functions, eight algorithms can be selected.
